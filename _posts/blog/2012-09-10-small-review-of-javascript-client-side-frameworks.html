Currently I am doing client javascript. We were starting a new big project so I had to decide what framework I would use in this project so I chose 4 frameworks to look through and also I had experience with Backbone. I also have read article <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/07/27/journey-through-the-javascript-mvc-jungle/">Journey Through The JavaScript MVC Jungle</a>
<br /><br />
<strong>1. <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a></strong><br /><br />

It was first I started with documentation as I always do. After reading documentation I understood very little because examples were a little so it was hard. After documentation I went to API after that I started looking forward for project examples on github but I found just <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/architecture-examples/emberjs">todo project</a>. So my understanding of Ember was bad and examples were a little. So I cant started doing project using Ember without understanding how to or some big project examples.<br /><br />

<strong>2. <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a></strong><br /><br />

I didn't like at the begging because It works with dom elements. And after Backbone I I didn't like way how it works so I rejected it after watching <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/architecture-examples/angularjs">todo project</a>.<br /><br />

<strong>3. <a href="http://spinejs.com/">Spine</a></strong><br /><br />

I liked this framework. It has good documentation and its better to use coffee in projects. But It's very simular to Backbone so I didn't find reason why I have to use Spine if Backbone more popular and so on.<br /><br />

<strong>4. <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a></strong><br /><br />

Its the most popular, it has a lot of big examples and its simple to use. But on big projects Backbone don't have many things so you have to write a lot by yourself.
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
My choice was <a href="https://github.com/paulmillr/brunch-with-chaplin">Brunch with Chaplin</a> (based on Backbone) and it has coffee as a main language. For big project Backbone is weak so we need to use some help tools.
