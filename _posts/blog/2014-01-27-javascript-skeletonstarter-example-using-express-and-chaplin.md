If you want to start a project in pure JavaScript it is one of the options of project structure. I was faced with this problem, considered a lot of projects and collect this one.
The project structure is divided into two parts, the frontend and backend. This two parts are very similar in structure using **MVC**. The app works on the principle of building ui based on data from the backend as **JSON**.
Also in this project you can find a few examples (authorization using passport, test coverage on frontend, etc.)
