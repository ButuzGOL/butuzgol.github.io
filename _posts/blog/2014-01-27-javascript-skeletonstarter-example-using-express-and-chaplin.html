If you want to start a project in pure JavaScript it is one of the options of project structure. I was faced with this problem, considered a lot of projects and collect this one.<br />
The project structure is divided into two parts, the frontend and backend. This two parts are very similar in structure using <strong>MVC</strong>. The app works on the principle of building ui based on data from the backend as <strong>JSON</strong>.<br />
Also in this project you can find a few examples (authorization using passport, test coverage on frontend, etc.)<br />
And of course <strong><a href="http://butuzgol-gss.herokuapp.com/">Demo</a></strong> (email@email.com:password)
