I have read several books or just watched inside code of Java books. So I will make some discussion about this books.<br /><br />

This book very simple and it shows standart basic programming also shows how to work with databases and very simple web development. In this book you can find how to install java and manipulate it only for windows. But I think it has not good structure.<br /><br />

<strong>Mark 4</strong><br /><br />

This book doesn't show the basic programming. I think this book you can read if you know basics and you just want to found out something more but it doesnt take you long time. Also this book has Android part (but it shows very basic).<br /><br />

<strong>Mark 4</strong><br /><br />

It shows very basic. And it has more 1000 pages. So for newb it will be good book but I think it will take him long time to read. Also it has good examples of warking with arrays, but I dont find in this book part with "Thread".<br /><br />

<img class="size-medium wp-image-626 aligncenter" title="Introduction to Java Programming, 8th Edition" src="/uploads/posts/blog/java-book3.png" alt="" width="236" height="300" /></a>It was my last book of Java. Also this book has 9 edition but I couldn't find it. So I started read 8th. This book is very cool for newb I never read so simple and it also has good structure. It has many examples. After each parts it has simple tasks. So I think this book would be good choice for somebody who doesn't know what is it programming and it doesn't scare him or her. Also I don't find in this book "Thread" but I think it will scare newb so they exclude.<br /><br />

<strong>Mark 4+</strong><br /><br />

<strong>P.S.</strong><br /><br />

For me Java very similar to another languages like PHP, C# ... so if you work with this languages you will understand Java very fast.
