I have read three books that were chosen very properly so I am going to tell you about them !<br />
<h3>First book was <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Development-Rails-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356549/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1333086171&amp;sr=8-1">Agile Web Development with Rails (4th edition)</a> </strong><em>mark 4/5</em></h3>
<img class="size-full wp-image-592 aligncenter noborder" title="" src="/uploads/posts/blog/rails-book.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="240" /><br /><br />
I like this book. It has tutorial on about 260 pages and about 200 pages of documentation that I ignored. The hardest part of book was deployment (I was making it on CentOS). Tutorial was making internet shop with ajax and default Rails testing.<br /><br />

You can see my source code on <a href="https://github.com/ButuzGOL/RailsBook_depot">github</a><br /><br />

<h3>Next book was <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rails-3-Action-Ryan-Bigg/dp/1935182277/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1333086171&amp;sr=8-8">Rails 3 in Action</a> </strong><em>mark 3/5</em></h3>
<img class="size-full wp-image-593 noborder aligncenter" title="" src="/uploads/posts/blog/rails-book1.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="251" /><br /><br />

It was hard book that consists of one tutorial of making ticket system. This book shows only some part of tutorial code so you have to look inside github repository for adding your project. It uses Rspec and Cucumber for testing and includes some gems (device for auth, cancan for acl etc).<br /><br />

<h3> Last book was <strong><a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book?version=3.2">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> </strong>mark 5/5</h3>
<img class="size-full wp-image-594 noborder aligncenter" title="" src="/uploads/posts/blog/rails-tutorial.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="200" /><br /><br />

Its perfect tutorial that give you all basic knowledge how to build website on Rails. It shows Rspec testing and basic knowledge of Rails. My opinion you cant do Rails without reading this tutorial.<br /><br />

<strong>P. S.</strong>  I like Rails its growing rapidly and it has many gems so it never be boring. Also there is several books that I am going to read.
