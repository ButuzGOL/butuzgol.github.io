<a href="http://todomvc.com/">TodoMVC.com</a> shows all popular JavaScript frameworks (in the way of app <a href="http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/backbone/">todolist</a> (with <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc">code</a>)) that can build your app using a lot of JavaScript calling backend throw api for data. So I waste a week to make fast review of this frameworks and choose what I prefer for building not small app.<br /><br />

In part JavaScript Apps I can underline several frameworks (<a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>, <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>, <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a>, <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs">Ext.js</a>, <a href="http://sammyjs.org/">Sammy.js</a>) other frameworks I don't like because they dont have good doc, tutorials, old or just I dont like their structure, code so on.<br />
So AngularJS and KnockoutJS they are using DOM bindings (I dont like this way events work) I think its cool for building something like calculator but for big apps with business logic its very hard and also I didn't find big app based on this two frameworks (give me a link) but as I know AngularJS has a big help from google so Its very popular.<br />
Ext.js I think because its closed and because it has a lot of components and for building app with own html its not good so it make sence to use this framework if you use Ext.js components like Grids and so on.<br />
Sammy.js it very tiny, has plugins, very similar to Backbone.js without Model and Collection, so I like it for small apps but for big apps I think it will be hard.<br />
Ember.js I like that they have Model with relation like HAS_ONE and so on and also I like templates some features. But after I started looking inside Router, Controller, View I understand that logic is very complicated and I dont like it.<br />
Backbone.js I work a lot with this lib so its very simple and I like its structure, but for big apps you have to use something over.<br /><br />

Next go to part Compile To JavaScript I like <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> as well as JavaScript so I want to underline what I like <a href="http://spinejs.com/">Spine.js</a> and <a href="http://batmanjs.org/">Batman.js</a>.
Spine.js may be the same as Backbone.js but Controller in Spine.js equal to View in Backbone.js.<br />
Batman.js has structure like Rails in some way and I really liked this framework but can't understand why in TodoList example they make all logic in Controller but not separate it to Controller View.<br />
Google framework like GWT and Dart shows how we can write JS in Java syntax and its very funny.<br />
TypeScript I like it but making typing in language without it, I cant figur out what for?<br /><br />

In part MVC Extension Frameworks there are three frameworks based on <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> so<br />
<a href="http://thoraxjs.org/">Thorex</a> I dont like because they suggest using Lumbard but I dont like this way of building app and it didn't give me a reason why I have to use it over Backbone.js.<br />
<a href="http://marionettejs.com/">Marrionet</a> very complicated. I don't like structure, it has some components that I found unnecessary like ItemView, and I didn't find big good examples.<br />
<a href="http://chaplinjs.org/">ChaplinJS</a> has good structure, has good big examples and I realy like this framework.<br /><br />

In part Module Loaders I can see using <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> with some frameworks and I think that its very good practice to use RequireJS because its makes strucuture of app looks better.<br /><br />

In part Real-time I see that I have to wait some time to see good framework for building big server/client js app. So for me those frmameworks is raw.<br /><br />

P.S. I just want to underline some frameworks that liked <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>, <a href="http://batmanjs.org/">Batman.js</a>Â and <a href="http://chaplinjs.org/">ChaplinJS</a>. They have structure that I really like.
