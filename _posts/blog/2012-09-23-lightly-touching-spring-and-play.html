My adventure to Java word is finished, after acquaintance with Spring and Play. So some words about this frameworks.<br /><br />

<strong>1. <a href="http://www.springsource.org/">Spring</a></strong>
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-640 noborder aligncenter" title="" src="/uploads/posts/blog/spring.png" alt="" width="300" height="26" />
At the beginning I went to official web site and there I found "Get Started". So there I found screencasts and tutorials but there were awful, and I dont know what to do next but then I went to google and type "Spring book"  and It show me StakeOverflow discussion, so there was link to "<a href="http://www.apress.com/java/spring/9781430241072">Pro Spring 3</a>".<br /><br />

So I tell you some words about Spring based on book. Spring is not just for web projects it has many components that would help in different projects, so this book shows how to use some of the components (mvc, data, integration, security, roo, etc) in examples. So I read the chapter -&gt; run the example -&gt; than look inside the code and try to understand what happening. It has very good examples, one of them is writing "Spring blog". So I like this book there are a lot of examples.<br /><br />

<strong>2. <a href="http://www.playframework.org/">Play</a></strong><br /><br />

My acquaintance with Play was one day so I just pass tutorial to understand what it is and was trying to find a book but there was no result. So my opinion Play is for writing small web sites but I will use PHP or etc but not Java.<br />
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
As I understand to be a good Java developer you have to be guru in Spring framework. And that cool that language have only one leading framework (as rails in Ruby but its different) that helps you in your projects. But after Ruby, Python and PHP I won't use Java in my projects. Bad side is that Eclipse is bad ide and Java(Spring) works a lot with xml.
