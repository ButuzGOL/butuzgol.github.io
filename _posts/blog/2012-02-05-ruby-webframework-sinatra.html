<img class="size-full wp-image-559 aligncenter noborder" title="logo" src="/uploads/posts/blog/sinatra.gif" alt="" width="156" height="108" /></a>It is very small framework but I think it has all needed things for building website. Also it is very light, you can see it on <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">main page of Sinatra Framework</a> that has example. It has good documentation full of examples. Also I found out that <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>Â  helps Sinatra. You can try it be tutorials that I found: <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/an-introduction-to-haml-and-sinatra/">net.tutsplus.com</a>, <a href="http://titusd.co.uk/2010/04/07/a-beginners-sinatra-tutorial/">titusd.co.uk</a>. Sinatra has two books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sinatra-Up-Running-Alan-Harris/dp/1449304230/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328434139&amp;sr=8-1">"Sinatra: Up and Running" on Amazon</a> (you will find tutorial when you would read last chapter so I build it and you can watch source code <a href="https://github.com/ButuzGOL/Sinatra-Tutorial-Up-And-Running">github.com</a>) and another book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sinatra-Up-Running-Alan-Harris/dp/1449304230/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328434139&amp;sr=8-1">on Sinatra website.</a> <strong></strong>

<strong>Sinatra really cool web framework that has good support.</strong>
