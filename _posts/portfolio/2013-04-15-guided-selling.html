When I came to my new job my lead told me that we need to rewrite existing app to html5 app. So we built single page app based on <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>Â that works on rest. Idea that backend its just api and frontend has business logic, dynamic and fully js. More information about product you can read <a href="http://www.selectica.com/cpq/guided-selling">here</a>.
