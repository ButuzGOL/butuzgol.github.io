In this project we decided to use CodeIgniter as a framework. It is almost nothing changed from the last time when I was using this framework. We used HMVC pattern not standard MVC. Also I think It is good solution to use CodeIgniter for small projects. In this project I tried Mootools at backend and I like it.
