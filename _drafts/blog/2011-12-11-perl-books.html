I had some free time so I decided to learn some new programming language so I chose Perl. I heard a lot about this language so I started reading books about this language. So I read two books, first was "Beginning Perl 3rd edition" and second was "Learning Perl 6th edition".<br /><br />

I'll start with the first book "Beginning Perl 3rd edition". This book I like not so much like Ruby book that also from Apress but this book has many examples and I think even if you don't know any programming language, you'll understand a lot but not all. So what I didn't like it's that about subs and class there was not many examples as I expected.<br /><br />

Second book was "Learning Perl 6th edition" I can say that it was very similar to previous book. But I didn't like this book there was not manyÂ  examples and they was build I think bad. For beginner this book would be hard and not understandable.<br /><br />

P.S. I want to say something about Perl language. It quite different from other languages it has some features that other languages don't have like variable $_ and different initialization of variable. Syntax I don't like because I know Ruby, Python so they have better one. And may be I don't right, but Pearl not popular like other languages. Also in Perl, work with subs and class is different from other languages.
