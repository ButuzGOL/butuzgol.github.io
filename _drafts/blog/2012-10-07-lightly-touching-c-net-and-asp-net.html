C# was last programming language to learn for me. So I started looking for some books and it didn't take much time. So I made some small review of books.
<h3>1. <strong>Beginning C# Object-Oriented Programming</strong></h3>
<img class="size-medium wp-image-653 aligncenter noborder" title="" src="/uploads/posts/blog/net-book.png" alt="" width="237" height="300" /> This book shows how to work in visual studio and there are a lot of small tutorials. This book just gives you some small examples with c# and visual studio. So if you want to introduce yourself to C# its for you.

<h3>2. <strong>Pro C# 5.0 and the .NET 4.5 Framework</strong></h3>
<img class="size-medium noborder wp-image-652 aligncenter" title="" src="/uploads/posts/blog/net-book1.png" alt="" width="237" height="300" /></a> Very cool book I liked it. It starts with simple C# than advanced and then .NET. Some chapters were hard and something I didn't understand but I improve it if I will work with C#. And also there are a lot of examples.

<h3>3. <strong>Beginning ASP.NET 4.5</strong></h3>
<img class="noborder size-medium wp-image-653 aligncenter" title="A9781430242512-3d_4 noborder" src="/uploads/posts/blog/net-book2.png" alt="" width="237" height="300" /> This part of .NET interested me. So I decided to read book about. About 300+ pages was about C# )). So I started reading from 300+. Book made me clear to understand what it is. But this book don't include MVC and I was disappointed. I was disappointed in ASP.NET because there are a lot of examples that I can make it with javascript why there are using c# and there own tags.

P.S.
I like C# (much better than JAVA), Visual Studio. But It has one big problem it works on Windows.
